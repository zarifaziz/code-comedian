The joke judge will speak like a hip mid 20s person in America.\n\nHere are the data models:\nclass Joke(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Joke class\"\"\"\n    content: str = Field(..., title=\"Content\", description=\"The entire joke content including the punchline\")\n\nclass FunnyRatingEnum(str, Enum):\n    \"\"\"Funny rating enum\"\"\"\n    NOT_FUNNY = \"not_funny\"\n    KINDA_FUNNY = \"kinda_funny\"\n    FUNNY = \"funny\"\n    VERY_FUNNY = \"very_funny\"\n    HILARIOUS = \"hilarious\"\n\nclass Judgement(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Judgement class\"\"\"\n    joke: Joke = Field(..., title=\"Joke\", description=\"The joke that was judged\")\n    funny_rating: FunnyRatingEnum = Field(..., title=\"Funny rating\", description=\"How funny is the joke?\")\n    explanation: str = Field(..., title=\"Explanation\", description=\"Explanation for the funny_rating\")\n\nI want the prompt to also contain few shot examples of input jokes and then output JokeJudgment dicts from the model. I will use these few shot examples in the prompt to run the model later. Go ahead and generate the System prompt now."

        "content": "Sure! Here are 10 more examples of developer jokes along with their ratings and explanations:\n\n1. Joke: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because it's easy on the REPLs! \n   Rating: FUNNY\n   Explanation: Ah, the joys of coding in the dark! This joke cleverly combines the programmer's affinity for dark mode with the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is a beloved tool used for interactive coding. It's a funny twist on the programmer's preference for a dark-themed coding environment.\n\n2. Joke: How do functions break up? They stop calling each other! \n   Rating: KINDA_FUNNY\n   Explanation: This joke plays on the concept of functions in programming, where functions call and interact with each other. Breaking up in this context refers to stopping the call, implying a pun on human relationships. While it elicits a chuckle, it doesn't reach the level of side-splitting laughter.\n\n3. Joke: Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because they didn't get closure!\n   Rating: VERY_FUNNY\n   Explanation: JavaScript and its sometimes elusive concept of closures... This joke brilliantly combines the two, evoking a sense of sympathy for the JavaScript developer who couldn't grasp closures fully. It's funny because closures can be quite a challenge for developers, and the play on words amplifies the humorous effect.\n\n4. Joke: How does a computer take a coffee break? It downloads Java!\n   Rating: HILARIOUS\n   Explanation: Oh, the wittiness! This joke flawlessly merges the computer's need for a coffee break with the Java programming language, known for its coffee-related name. The imagery of a computer \"downloading\" Java as if it's taking a break is absolutely hilarious. Prepare for some serious laughter!\n\n5. Joke: Why did the programmer always carry a pencil and paper? In case they needed to draw a byte!\n   Rating: FUNNY\n   Explanation: Ah, the programmer's preparedness at its finest! This joke cleverly combines the need for writing instruments with the concept of a byte in programming. It tickles the funny bone with the idea that a programmer might need to physically draw a byte, which is typically represented by 8 bits of data.\n\n6. Joke: Why did the developer go broke? Their friend convinced them to invest in CODEcoin!\n   Rating: NOT_FUNNY\n   Explanation: Sorry, but this joke missed the mark. The punchline relies on the concept of a fictional cryptocurrency named CODEcoin, but it fails to deliver a clever or unexpected twist. It didn't generate laughter or amusement and leaves us wanting for a better joke.\n\n7. Joke: Why couldn't the SQL statement go to the party? It had too many joins!\n   Rating: FUNNY\n   Explanation: Ah, SQL humor at its best! This joke cleverly puns on the term \"join\" in SQL statements, which allows the combination of data from different tables. The idea that a SQL statement couldn't attend a party because it had too many \"joins\" is a delightful twist that programmer's will appreciate.\n\n8. Joke: How do programmers stay warm in winter? They make sure to wrap their code in layers!\n   Rating: VERY_FUNNY\n   Explanation: This joke lightheartedly renders the act of wrapping code in layers synonymous with dressing warmly in winter. It's a witty play on the physical act of layering clothing and the metaphorical act of organizing code with proper architectural layers. A definite winner in the humor department!\n\n9. Joke: Why do developers prefer dark chocolate? It matches their dark theme editors!\n   Rating: KINDA_FUNNY\n   Explanation: This joke draws a connection between developers' preference for dark-themed code editors and their hypothetical tendency to prefer dark chocolate. While it elicits a smile, it falls slightly short of reaching the highest level of hilarity due to the simplicity of the correlation between dark chocolate and dark theme editors.\n\n10. Joke: What's a programmer's favorite hangout place? The Foo Bar!\n    Rating: FUNNY\n    Explanation: Ah, the legendary Foo Bar! This joke wonderfully references the ubiquitous term \"Foo Bar,\" commonly used in programming examples and exercises. It implies that the programmer's favorite place to hang out is the Foo Bar, which is a geeky nod to the programming world. It's a solid dose of programmer humor!\n\nThat wraps up the ratings and explanations for these developer jokes. Remember, comedy is subjective, and different jokes resonate differently with people. But fear not, Code Comedian is here to find the humor in any situation and deliver laugh-inducing analyses!"
