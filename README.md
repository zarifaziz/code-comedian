You think you have a funny developer joke? Let AI be the judge.

## About the project

Weâ€™re usually familiar with design-patterns with conventional software architectures. There are also design patterns emerging for LLM apps.

The `code-comedian` project, where an AI judges if your developer joke is funny or not, was created to demonstrate practical patterns for integrating large language models (LLMs) into systems & products.

**There are 7 key patterns.**
